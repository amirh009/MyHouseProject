Much more interactable</li>\r\n     <li>Processing Code vs. Paint instructions:\r\n         <ul>\r\n             <li>In Processing, or any programming language for that matter, there is no room for ambiguity whereas humans are able to interpret almost anything </li>\r\n             <li>Paint instructions are can be much simpilar and also much more human readable.</li>\r\n             <li>However, Processing is much more precise because a computer cannot make a mistake, the only thing that can be flawed is the code</li>\r\n         </ul>\r\n        </li>\r\n        \r\n    </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
