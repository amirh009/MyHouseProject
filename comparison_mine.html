<p>-Apart from the black outlining, the houses are pretty much identical.</p>
<p>-Also, some of the coordinates are not exact because I used gridlines rather than exact coordinates.</p>
<p>-These were my instructions through paint:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on view on the top and in the section of  &ldquo;show or hide&rdquo;, check the box that says &ldquo;Gridlines&rdquo;</li>
  <li>In the shapes section click on the rectangle  icon</li>
  <li>Click on color two then green and repeat with  color one</li>
  <li>Click the fill bucket in shapes and click solid  color</li>
  <li>Then make a green rectangle that fills the  bottom half of the page</li>
  <li>Select blue ( the blue that is three from the  right top row) for color 1 and color 2</li>
  <li>Make a blue rectangle that fills the top half of  an image</li>
  <li>color 1 to black and color 2 to white</li>
  <li>make a large square in the middle of the screen,  29 pixels from the left, 29 pixels from the right, 12 pixels from the bottom  and 10 pixels from the top</li>
  <li>make a smaller (8 pixels by 13 pixels)  horizontal rectangle from the center bottom of the square (about 14 pixels from  each side</li>
  <li>make two other small squares near the corners of  the two top corners of the bigger square, each 6 x 8 pixels, each 5 pixels from  the sides of the square and 5 from the top</li>
  <li>In shapes, click on the triangle</li>
  <li>Click and drag from the top left point to the  top right point of the square then pull up about 7 pixels</li>
  <li>Click on the rectangle icon again in shapes</li>
  <li>On the right side of the triangle you just made,  3 pixels from the edge, make a vertical rectangle that is 7 x 9 pixels</li>
  <li>Click on the bucket in tools, then select the  color red (forth from the top row left).</li>
  <li>Click on the big square so that it becomes red</li>
  <li>Then in the same way, make the rectangles (doors  and mirrors) inside the square purple (top row last) </li>
  <li>Then in the same way, make the triangle and the  chimney orange (top row, fifth)</li>
  <li>Click on the circle in shapes and draw a circle  that is on the right side, 1 pixel from the top and 5 pixels from the right  side of the screen</li>
  <li>Fill that circle in yellow ( top row sixth) in  the way you did in steps 15, 17, and 18</li>
  <li>Click on the rectangle icon and on the left side  create a 9 x 24 rectangle that is 6 pixels from the left side of the page and  16 pixels from the bottom</li>
  <li>Fill that rectangle with brown ( bottom row  third) in the way u did before</li>
  <li>Finally, click on the circle icon in shapes and  create an oval that is one pixel from the top of the image, two pixels from the  left side of the image, and slightly overlaps the brown rectangle.</li>
  <li>Fill that in green ( top row, forth from right)</li>
  <li>Now you should have a red house with purple  windows, an orange roof and chimney, a blue sky, a green yard, a tree and a  sun.</li>
